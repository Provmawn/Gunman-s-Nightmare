# Gunman's Nightmare

This game is about a guy known as "gunman" who is trapped in a nightmare and is trying to escape by killing all of the demons with his gun.

## Background

This is a game I created when I was a junior in highschool. At that point in time I wanted to create something amazing. Looking back, the code it not perfect and I remeber I wanted to add parallax scrolling but I didn't know how it worked at all. It is great to see how far I have come with my programming and I always enjoy looking back on this project.
